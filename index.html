  <p>My name is Kevin Thomas. I am an 18-year-old studying Industrial Management and Information Systems at the University of Cincinnati. I was born in Warren, Ohio (Just outside of Youngstown, Ohio) where I lived for the first few years of my life. After that, I lived in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania (Just outside of Pittsburgh) for a couple of years before finally moving to Hilliard, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, Ohio. I grew up there with my little sister (Calli) and my little brother (Jacob). Both of my parents went to The Ohio State University, so naturally I was a Buckeye fan growing up. I am still a huge Ohio State fan but I am also an avid UC fan.

I have always been interested in finding the best way to complete a task. When I was little, it was figuring out the best way to build fake cities using Rokenbok. As I got older, I always wanted to find not only the best way, but the fastest way.  Whenever I drove anywhere, my goal was to find the trip that was the fastest with the fewest miles. That when I realized that I wanted to go into the field of supply chin management and logistics. I have also always been very passionate about computers and new technology. I am the go to “tech guy” for all of my friends and family.</p>
